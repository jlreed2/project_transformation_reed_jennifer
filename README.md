##Resources
* Boilerplate - Used the visually hidden class as provided in lecture [https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169)


##Coments
* There were pieces of this (assigned week 6) assignmemt and the week 6 homework that made much more sense after watching the week 7 videos. 
* For my first ever attempt at a responsive site, it was a bit rough going. Re-learning everything we have been previously taught (floats, fixed pixel fonts/element widths, etc) may take some getting used to.
